Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character

Here's the JavaScript code to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of operations required to convert one word to another:

```javascript
function minDistance(word1, word2) {
  const m = word1.length;
  const n = word2.length;
  
  // Create a 2D array to store the minimum operations
  const dp = Array(m + 1).fill().map(() => Array(n + 1).fill(0));
  
  // Fill the first row and column of the dp array
  for (let i = 0; i <= m; i++) {
    dp[i][0] = i;
  }
  for (let j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
    dp[0][j] = j;
  }
  
  // Fill the dp array
  for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
      if (word1[i - 1] === word2[j - 1]) {
        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
      } else {
        dp[i][j] = 1 + Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1]);
      }
    }
  }
  
  return dp[m][n];
}

// Example usage
console.log(minDistance("horse", "ros")); // Output: 3
console.log(minDistance("intention", "execution")); // Output: 5
```

Explanation:

1. We define a function called `minDistance` that takes two strings `word1` and `word2` as input.

2. We initialize variables `m` and `n` to store the lengths of `word1` and `word2`, respectively.

3. We create a 2D array called `dp` of size `(m + 1) x (n + 1)` to store the minimum number of operations required to convert substrings of `word1` to substrings of `word2`. The extra row and column are used for empty strings.

4. We fill the first row and column of the `dp` array with the number of operations required to convert an empty string to the corresponding substring of `word2` or `word1`, respectively.

5. We iterate over the remaining cells of the `dp` array using nested loops.

6. For each cell, we check if the characters at the corresponding positions in `word1` and `word2` are the same. If they are the same, we copy the value from the cell diagonally up and to the left.

7. If the characters are different, we take the minimum value among three possibilities:
   - Insert a character (value from the cell above + 1)
   - Delete a character (value from the cell to the left + 1)
   - Replace a character (value from the cell diagonally up and to the left + 1)

8. After filling the entire `dp` array, the value in the bottom-right cell `dp[m][n]` gives the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`.

9. Finally, we return the value of `dp[m][n]`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(mn), where m and n are the lengths of `word1` and `word2`, respectively. The space complexity is also O(mn) to store the `dp` array.
