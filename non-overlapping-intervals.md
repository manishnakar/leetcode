Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.


Here's a JavaScript code that solves the problem of finding the minimum number of intervals to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping:

```javascript
function eraseOverlapIntervals(intervals) {
  if (intervals.length === 0) {
    return 0;
  }

  // Sort the intervals based on the end time
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]);

  let count = 0;
  let prevEnd = intervals[0][1];

  for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
    if (intervals[i][0] < prevEnd) {
      // Overlapping interval found, increment the count
      count++;
    } else {
      // Update the previous end time
      prevEnd = intervals[i][1];
    }
  }

  return count;
}
```

Explanation:

1. We first check if the `intervals` array is empty. If it is, we return 0 since there are no intervals to remove.

2. We sort the `intervals` array based on the end time of each interval in ascending order. This step is crucial because it allows us to greedily select the intervals with the earliest end time.

3. We initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of intervals to remove.

4. We also initialize a variable `prevEnd` to store the end time of the previously selected interval. Initially, it is set to the end time of the first interval.

5. We iterate through the sorted `intervals` array starting from the second interval (index 1).

6. For each interval, we check if its start time is less than the `prevEnd`. If it is, it means the current interval overlaps with the previously selected interval. In this case, we increment the `count` variable to indicate that we need to remove an interval.

7. If the current interval does not overlap with the previously selected interval, we update the `prevEnd` to the end time of the current interval.

8. After iterating through all the intervals, we return the `count`, which represents the minimum number of intervals to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of intervals. The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a constant amount of extra space.

You can test the code with the following example:

```javascript
const intervals = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [1, 3]];
const result = eraseOverlapIntervals(intervals);
console.log(result); // Output: 1
```

In this example, we need to remove at least one interval to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping. The minimum number of intervals to remove is 1.
