Given 3 positives numbers a, b and c. Return the minimum flips required in some bits of a and b to make ( a OR b == c ). (bitwise OR operation).
Flip operation consists of change any single bit 1 to 0 or change the bit 0 to 1 in their binary representation.


Here's the JavaScript code to solve the problem of finding the minimum flips required in the bits of `a` and `b` to make `a OR b` equal to `c`:

```javascript
function minFlips(a, b, c) {
  let flips = 0;

  while (a > 0 || b > 0 || c > 0) {
    const bitA = a & 1;
    const bitB = b & 1;
    const bitC = c & 1;

    if (bitC === 0) {
      if (bitA === 1 && bitB === 1) {
        flips += 2;
      } else if (bitA === 1 || bitB === 1) {
        flips += 1;
      }
    } else {
      if (bitA === 0 && bitB === 0) {
        flips += 1;
      }
    }

    a >>= 1;
    b >>= 1;
    c >>= 1;
  }

  return flips;
}
```

Explanation:

1. We initialize a variable `flips` to keep track of the minimum number of flips required.

2. We start a loop that continues as long as any of `a`, `b`, or `c` has remaining bits to process.

3. Inside the loop, we extract the least significant bits of `a`, `b`, and `c` using the bitwise AND operation with `1`. We store these bits in `bitA`, `bitB`, and `bitC`, respectively.

4. We then check the value of `bitC`:
   - If `bitC` is `0`, it means we need the corresponding bits of `a` and `b` to be `0` as well. If both `bitA` and `bitB` are `1`, we need to flip both bits, so we increment `flips` by 2. If either `bitA` or `bitB` is `1`, we need to flip one bit, so we increment `flips` by 1.
   - If `bitC` is `1`, it means we need at least one of the corresponding bits of `a` and `b` to be `1`. If both `bitA` and `bitB` are `0`, we need to flip one bit, so we increment `flips` by 1.

5. After processing the current bits, we right-shift `a`, `b`, and `c` by 1 position to move to the next bits.

6. We repeat steps 3-5 until all bits of `a`, `b`, and `c` have been processed.

7. Finally, we return the total number of flips required.

You can test the code with different inputs to verify its correctness. For example:

```javascript
console.log(minFlips(2, 6, 5)); // Output: 3
console.log(minFlips(4, 2, 7)); // Output: 1
console.log(minFlips(1, 2, 3)); // Output: 0
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(log(max(a, b, c))), where `max(a, b, c)` represents the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`. This is because the loop runs for the number of bits in the largest input number. The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a constant amount of extra space.
